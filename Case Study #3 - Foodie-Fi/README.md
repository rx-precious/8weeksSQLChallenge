# **Problem Statement**
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```SQL
WITH a AS (
  SELECT customer_id, a.plan_id, plan_name, start_date,
    LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS nextSub,
    datediff(LEAD(start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id), start_date) AS diff
  FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions a
  JOIN foodie_fi.plans b on a.plan_id = b.plan_id
  WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19))

SELECT customer_id, plan_id, diff
FROM a
WHERE plan_id = 0;
```
| customer_id | plan_id | diff |
|-------------|---------|------|
|           1 |       0 |    7 |
|           2 |       0 |    7 |
|          11 |       0 |    7 |
|          13 |       0 |    7 |
|          15 |       0 |    7 |
|          16 |       0 |    7 |
|          18 |       0 |    7 |
|          19 |       0 |    7 |

#### Answer
- From the table, each customer of foodie-fi initially subscribed to the trial plan of the company and didnt upgrade nor churned until the trial expired.

```SQL
SELECT  customer_id, plan_name, month(LEAD(start_date) OVER ()) - month(start_date) AS SubscriptionMonths
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions a
JOIN foodie_fi.plans b on a.plan_id = b.plan_id
WHERE customer_id = 19;
```

| customer_id | plan_name   | SubscriptionMonths |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------|
|          19 | trial       |                  0 |
|          19 | pro monthly |                  2 |
|          19 | pro annual  |               NULL |

#### Answer
- Customer_id 19 subscribed for the pro monthly plan for 2 months after enjoyinf the free tral before migrating to a pro annual plan

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions a
JOIN foodie_fi.plans b on a.plan_id = b.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (1,2,11,18);
```
| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
|           1 | trial         | 2020-08-01 |
|           1 | basic monthly | 2020-08-08 |
|           2 | trial         | 2020-09-20 |
|           2 | pro annual    | 2020-09-27 |
|          11 | trial         | 2020-11-19 |
|          11 | churn         | 2020-11-26 |
|          18 | trial         | 2020-07-06 |
|          18 | pro monthly   | 2020-07-13 |

#### Answer
- Customer_id 1, 18, and 2 after enjoying the free trial subscribed for the basic monthly, pro monthly and pro annual subscriptions respectively. Customer 11 churned after the trial period.

```SQL
SELECT customer_id, plan_name, start_date
FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions a
JOIN foodie_fi.plans b on a.plan_id = b.plan_id
WHERE customer_id IN (13,15,16);
```
| customer_id | plan_name     | start_date |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
|          13 | trial         | 2020-12-15 |
|          13 | basic monthly | 2020-12-22 |
|          13 | pro monthly   | 2021-03-29 |
|          15 | trial         | 2020-03-17 |
|          15 | pro monthly   | 2020-03-24 |
|          15 | churn         | 2020-04-29 |
|          16 | trial         | 2020-05-31 |
|          16 | basic monthly | 2020-06-07 |
|          16 | pro annual    | 2020-10-21 |

#### Answer

FROM lastPlanTable a
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id AND a.start_date = b.start_date
CROSS JOIN nCustomers
JOIN foodie_fi.plans c ON b.plan_id = c.plan_id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY b.plan_id;
```

| plan_name     | nCustomers | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| trial         |         19 |        1.9 |

SELECT COUNT(*) AS nCount
FROM a
WHERE newPlan = 3;
```

| nCount |
|--------|
|    195 |
#### Answer
- A total of 195 subscribers had upgraded to an annual plan in the year 2020

### 9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
```SQL
WITH trialTable AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0),
	annualTable AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 3)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)), 0) AS averageDays
FROM trialTable a
JOIN annualTable b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id;
```
| averageDays |
|-------------|
|         105 |

#### Answer
--It takes an average of 105 days for a customer to upgrade to the pro annual sunscription.

### 10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
```SQL
WITH trialTable AS (
	SELECT *
	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 0),
	annualTable AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 3),
    periods AS (
    SELECT a.customer_id,
		CASE
			WHEN CEIL(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)/30) = 1
				THEN CONCAT(CEIL(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)/30) - 1, ' - ', CEIL(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)/30) * 30 , ' days')
			ELSE CONCAT((CEIL(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)/30) - 1) *30 + 1, ' - ', CEIL(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)/30) * 30 , ' days')
            END AS periods,
		(CEIL(datediff(b.start_date, a.start_date)/30) - 1) *30 + 1 AS OrderColumn
	FROM trialTable a
	JOIN annualTable b ON a.customer_id = b.customer_id
	GROUP BY 1)

SELECT periods, COUNT(*) nCustomers
FROM periods
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY OrderColumn ;
```
| periods        | nCustomers |
|----------------|------------|
| 0 - 30 days    |         49 |
| 31 - 60 days   |         24 |
| 61 - 90 days   |         34 |
| 91 - 120 days  |         35 |
| 121 - 150 days |         42 |
| 151 - 180 days |         36 |
| 181 - 210 days |         26 |
| 211 - 240 days |          4 |
| 241 - 270 days |          5 |
| 271 - 300 days |          1 |
| 301 - 330 days |          1 |
| 331 - 360 days |          1 |

#### Answer
- The frequency distribution looks right skewed meaning most of the subcribers of Foodie Fi that upgraded to the annual plan did so early.

### 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
```SQL
WITH a AS (
	SELECT *, LEAD(plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY plan_id) AS downPlan_id
	FROM foodie_fi.subscriptions
    WHERE year(start_date) <= 2020
	)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nDowngradeCust
FROM a
WHERE plan_id = 2 AND downPlan_id = 1;
```
| nDowngradeCust |
|----------------|
|              0 |

#### Answer
- No customer downgraded from the pro monthly to basic monthly in the year 2020.
