# 8 Weeks SQL Challenge

This repository contains my attempt at solving the case studies in the 8 weeks SQL Challenge put together by @DataWithDanny. The case studies resonates with my focus as a Supply chain professional as seen in some case studies which focus on improving customer service level `Case Study 2`, Supply chain strategy `Case Study 5` and product segmentation `Case Study 7`.

The Case studies contain datasets from the following domains:
- Health analytics
- Marketing analytics
- People analytics
- Financial markets
- Fast moving consumer goods
- Digital marketing
